# hello_world
My first repository

Hi, I am leraning about git-hub for the first time.
Here's what i have learned so far.

1) A repository is basically your project file.
2) Your main code file is in the Master branch. You can make copies of it using branches. Its is used for maintaining different verions of codes without affecting the Master branch.
3) You can make changes to branches (commits-saved changes).
